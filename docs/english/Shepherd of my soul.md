# Shepherd of my soul  

Shepherd of my soul I give You full control  
Wherever You may lead I will follow  
I have made the choice to listen for Your voice  
Wherever You may lead I will go  

Shepherd of my soul I give You full control  
Wherever You may lead I will follow  
I have made the choice to listen for Your voice  
Wherever You may lead I will go  

Be it in a quiet pasture or by a gentle breeze  
The shepherd of my soul is by my side  
Should I face a mighty mountain or a valley dark and deep  
The shepherd of my soul will be my guide  

Shepherd of my soul I give You full control  
Wherever You may lead I will follow  
I have made the choice to listen for Your voice  
Wherever You may lead I will go  

Be it in a quiet pasture or by a gentle breeze  
The shepherd of my soul is by my side  
And should I face a mighty mountain or a valley dark and deep  
The shepherd of my soul will be my guide  

The Shepherd of my soul I give You full control  
Wherever You may lead I will follow  
I have made the choice to listen for Your voice  
Wherever You may lead I will go  
Wherever wherever You may lead I will go
