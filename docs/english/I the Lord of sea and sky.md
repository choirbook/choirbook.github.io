# I, the Lord of sea and sky,  

I, the Lord of sea and sky,  
I have heard my people cry.  
All who dwell in dark and sin,  
my hand will save.  

I, who made the stars of night,  
I will make their darkness bright.  
Who will bear my light to them?  
Whom shall I send?  

Here I am, Lord.  Is it I, Lord?  
I have heard you calling in the night.  
I will go, Lord, if you lead me.  
I will hold your people in my heart.  

I, the Lord of snow and rain,  
I have borne my peopleâ€™s pain.  
I have wept for love of them.  
They turn away.  

I will break their hearts of stone,  
give them hearts for love alone.  
I will speak my words to them.  
Whom shall I send?  

Here I am, Lord...  

I, the Lord of wind and flame,  
I will send the poor and lame.  
I will set a feast for them.  
My hand will save.  
Finest bread I will provide  
till their hearts be satisfied.  
I will give my life to them.  
Whom shall I send?  

Here I am, Lord...
