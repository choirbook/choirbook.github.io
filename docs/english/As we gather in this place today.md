# As we gather in this place today

As we gather in this place today  
Holy Spirit come and have Your way, have Your way  
As we lay aside our own desires  
Sweep across our hearts with Holy fire, have Your way  

This is Your house, Your home  
We welcome You, Lord, we welcome You  
This is Your house, Your home  
We welcome You today  

As we offer up our hearts and lives  
Let them be a living sacrifice, oh have Your way  
Be glorified in everything we do  
Be glorified in everything we say, oh have Your way  

This is Your house, Your home  
We welcome You, Lord, we welcome You  
This is Your house, Your home  
We welcome You today
