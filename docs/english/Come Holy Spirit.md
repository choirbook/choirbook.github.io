# Come Holy Spirit (Fall on me)  

Come Holy Spirit  
Fall on me now  
I need Your anointing  
Come in Your power  
I love You Holy Spirit  
You're captivating my soul  
And everyday I grow to love You more  


Come Holy Spirit  
Fall on me now  
I need Your anointing  
Come in Your power  
I love You Holy Spirit  
You're captivating my soul  
And everyday I grow to love You more  


I'm reaching for Your heart  
You hold my life into Your hands  
Drawing me closer to You  
I feel Your power renew  
Nothing compares to this place  
Where I can see You face to face  

I worship You in spirit and in truth
