# One small child  

One small child in a land of a thousand  
One small dream of a Savior tonight  
One small hand reaching out to the starlight  
One small Savior of life, ooh  

One king bringing his gold and riches  
One King ruling an army of might  
One king kneeling with incense and candlelight  
One King bringing us life, ooh  

See Him lying, a cradle beneath Him  
See Him smiling in the stall  
See His mother praising His Father  
See His tiny eyelids fall  

See the shepherds kneeling before Him  
See the kings on bended knee  
Oh, see the mother praising the Father  
See the blessed infant sleep
