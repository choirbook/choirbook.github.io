# Heart of Worship  

When the music fades  
All is stripped away  
And I simply come  
Longin' just to bring  
Something that's of worth  
That will bless Your heart  
I'll bring You more than a song  
For a song in itself  
Is not what You have required  
You search much deeper within  
Through the ways things appear  
You're looking into my heart  
I'm comin' back to the heart of worship  
And it's all about You  
It's all about You, Jesus  
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it  
When it's all about You  
It's all about You, Jesus  
King of endless worth  
No one could express  
How much You deserve?  
Though I'm weak and poor  
All I have is Yours  
Every single breath  
I'll bring You more than a song  
For a song in itself  
Is not what You have required  
You search much deeper within  
Through the way things appear  
You're looking into my heart, yeah  
I'm comin' back to the heart of worship  
And it's all about You  
It's all about You, Jesus  
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it  
When it's all about You  
It's all about You, Jesus
